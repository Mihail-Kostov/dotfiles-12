Saying that Emacs is just a text editor is like calling iPhone just a
phone. [[http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2007/12/13/emacs-with-auctex-as-a-latex-ide/][Luke - Terminally Incoherent]]

While any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your
soul. (Per Abrahamsen)

Show me your ~/.emacs and I will tell you who you are. (Bogdan
Maryniuk)

The reasonable man adapts himself to Emacs; the unreasonable one
persists in trying to adapt Emacs to himself. Therefore all progress
depends on the unreasonable man. (G.B. Shaw)
