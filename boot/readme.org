#+STARTUP: overview

* Install strategy
this is where I maintain the installation process files
* Options
- note: the user can define his own git url to define from where he wants to grab his dependencies.
- that's useful, for example, if you mantain your own private gilab server.
- you just have to create a file that populates a zsh associative array:
  1. create a file called =~/.options/urlhash.zsh=
  2. populate the file like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
urlhash[awesome/dependency]=https://mycustom.gitlab.server.com/awesome/dendency.git
urlhash[foo/bar]=https://foo.com/cgit/baz.git
#+END_SRC

- that's it.
