* Simplicity, speed and power while working inside the shell.

## Important notice 

* These are my personal configuration files, which are in a constant state of change as I develop my environment across several systems. I can't guarantee that these configurations will work for you, at all. So if you encounter problems with them, you're pretty much on your own. Still, it can be useful and instructional to look around and take bits and snippets to use within your own configuration files. (this notice was based on [aaron bieber's dotfiles](https://github.com/aaronbieber/dotfiles))

## Install Instructions

* First off, I strongly recommend using [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2.git) on OSx.
* Secondly, this is for unix systems: `GNU/Linux`, `OSx`, etc... It should work on theory on windows, but I've faced a lot of configuration issues and ended up abandoning windows support.
* configure your terminal to use the [gruvbox theme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox). There's a `conf` folder within this repo that can help you with that. 
* **recommendation**: I use and recommend the excelent [monoid](https://github.com/larsenwork/monoid) font.
* now get `vim` 8+ with [+clipboard](http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/11/getting-vim-with-clipboard-support).
* get [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux.git) 2.3+
* get [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh.git) 5.2+ and make sure that `/bin/zsh` is valid. (if not: `$ cd /bin && sudo ln -s $(command -v zsh) zsh`)
* `cat /etc/shells` and verify that zsh appears on the list. If not, `sudo vi /etc/shells` and append `/bin/zsh`
* get [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher.git) (you can `brew install ag` on OSx).
* if you're on OSx, brew install these:
  * `brew install coreutils` (mainly because `BSD` `ls` `CLICOLOR` sucks).
  * `brew install reattach-to-user-namespace` (Mainly because of the `open` utility. [more info here](https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard.git)).
  * `brew install diff-so-fancy`

* __Kind remark__: for the moment (until I change the script to back it up for you), I'll overwrite your `~/.gitconfig` file, so if you have something important in it, now would be the perfect moment to back it up.

## Shell time

* note: the install.zsh script basically does this:
  - mounts symlinks on your home folder;
  - creates ~/.options/shell-options.conf file, if not existent
  - overwrites your .gitconfig (so back it up if you have something important)
  - install/updates vim plugins
  

* open your shell and write this:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ninrod/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ ~/.dotfiles/install.zsh
```

* now a `~/.options/shell-options.conf` was created for you and you will setup your github configuration in it.

```sh
$ vim ~/.options/shell-options.conf
$ exec zsh
```

* That's it, your're all set.


## Emacs: the timeless and infinitely powerful editor

I maintain my configuration using an org-mode file, trough org-babel. 

So you can see it in it's full glory [here](https://github.com/ninrod/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs.d/boot.org).

## VIM: Powerful shell text editor. Tweaked with plugins.

* To check out what binds and plugins I use in this config, my [vimrc](https://github.com/ninrod/dotfiles/blob/master/dot/vimrc) file is authoritative.

* That said, it is worth noting that I've remapped `<space>` to be an alias to the `<leader>` key.

## TMUX custom binds

* checkout the [tmux.conf](https://github.com/ninrod/dotfiles/blob/master/dot/tmux.conf) file for tmux binding setup.
